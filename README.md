# 👋 Hi there, I'm Meiling Li!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I’m a Data Student with a GIS background and a strong foundation in Python, data mining, big data, and spatial analysis. Currently pursuing a Data Analytics program at the University of Canterbury, I’ve worked on projects involving:
Spatial data analysis & visualization of geospatial datasets
Text mining & NLP for extracting insights from unstructured data
Predictive modeling and scalable data pipelines
Business-oriented dashboards and decision support analytics
Beyond technical expertise, I’m expanding into business analytics — focusing on KPI-driven insights, data storytelling, and strategic reporting. Skilled in Excel (Power Query), Power BI, and Tableau, I can translate complex datasets into clear, actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making.
